Text Analysis and Sentiment Scoring with NLP
This project showcases an application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to extract, analyze, and interpret textual data from various online articles. Utilizing Python and libraries such as NLTK, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas, the project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to understanding and quantifying the sentiment and readability of textual content.

Overview
The core objective of this project is to perform detailed text analysis on a set of articles obtained from provided URLs. The analysis encompasses sentiment scoring, readability assessment, and extraction of various textual metrics critical for NLP tasks. The project not only highlights the practical application of NLP and AI methodologies but also emphasizes data extraction and manipulation using Python.

Key Components
Data Extraction: Implementing web scraping techniques to retrieve article texts from specified URLs, focusing on extracting meaningful content while filtering out HTML markup and irrelevant sections.

Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing positive and negative word lists to compute sentiment scores for each article, enabling a nuanced understanding of the overall sentiment conveyed by the text.

Readability Metrics: Calculating various readability indices, such as the Fog Index and Average Sentence Length, to assess the complexity and accessibility of the text.

Text Processing: Employing NLP techniques for tokenization, stop word removal, and complex word identification, facilitating a deeper linguistic analysis of the articles.

Result Compilation: Aggregating analysis results alongside original article metadata into a structured output, typically an Excel file, showcasing the ability to synthesize and present findings effectively.

Implementation
The project is implemented in Python, making extensive use of libraries like requests for web scraping, BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, nltk for natural language processing tasks, and pandas for data manipulation and output generation. Special attention is given to error handling and data quality to ensure robustness and reliability of the analysis.

Applications
This project serves as a testament to the practical applications of NLP and AI in processing and analyzing textual data.
